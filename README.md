# Rockbuster Movie Rental Analysis

# Project Overview
A demo project using the PostgreSQL database and the pgAdmin tool to analyze data of a fictional movie rental company

# Context
To remain competitive against rising streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, Rockbuster aims to leverage existing movie licenses by launching an online video rental service. 
My role as a Business Intelligence Analyst is to provide actionable insights and data-driven recommendations by analyzing customer behaviour and patterns.

# Objectives
This analysis aims to identify key trends, opportunities, and potential challenges, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning.
For the launch strategy the management board has provided critical questions which needs to be answered: 
1.Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
2.What was the average rental duration for all videos?
3.Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
4.Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
5.Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

# Data
